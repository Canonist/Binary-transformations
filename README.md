# Binary-transformations
Building a quick toolscript for transforming binary strings.

Version 1:
Basic structure for developments built. Capable of taking in a binary string and turning it into a regular ASCII number string.
//This is likely going to end up rarely updated as I feel the need to, a very much incremental side project.
